TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I have learned about binary search and how they eliminate numbers that does not fit in the given values. 
I also learned how to combine 2 types of code together as a  function 
Learned how to write a code where I can combine both numbers and strings together and using f strings to assess values in between a low and high values.
