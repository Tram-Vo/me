TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I've learn how to set up my dev environment and complete activities on Visual Studio as well as also checking my working errors through programming. 
I have also learned that Python can store your personal database, it's a tool that helps us to do different thing though different commands. 
I have struggled with following some instructions given on github and need some assistant of my tutors to finish my week 1 exercises.
